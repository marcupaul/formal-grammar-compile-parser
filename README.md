# formal-grammar-compile-parser

This project contains a toy Python application meant to implement a recursive descent parser for a given grammar. Included are `.txt` files defining three different grammar examples to highlight execution. In order to organize and execute the parsing flow, it primarily utilizes the built-in Python `Queue` module.
